            <title><![CDATA[About]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About</h1><p>2K/DENMARK was founded in 1987 as 2Krogh, a graphic design startup that took it’s name from it’s two founders Liv and Klaus Krogh. The name was changed to 2K/DENMARK in conjunction with our 25th anniversary celebrations in 2012.

2K/DENMARK are designers, turned typesetters, turned software developers. Today we offer a range of services, both digitally and in printed media, delivering only high quality results.

Our list of references will show that we have been around for many years, but partnering with us does not result in 25 year old design – we are constantly on the edge of technological development, and will rather develop solutions on our own than wait for others to provide them.

With our roots deep in typography, design and art history, we understand the written and unwritten rules – and why the rules were made to begin with. We dare to find new solutions, using new technology and the possibilities that modern software provides; and when the tools we develop are in demand from others, innovation turns part of our business.

2K/DENMARK values sustainability and uses FSC® certified Gmund Papers.</p></article>]]></description>
