description: 'In 2011, the Norwegian Bible Society launched two new translations of the bible. Two translations, directly from the original scripture and into modern Norwegian language, with the explicit aim of conveying the imagery and poetry of the bible to contemporary readers. Having spent 12 years perfecting the translation, the Norwegian Bible Society trusted 2K/DENMARK with designing the trend line. They wanted six designs, three midsize and three small volumes, set in two dialects. 2K/DESIGN set out to create books you’d want to experience with more that your eyes. As objects you’d want to hold.'

Art Director Andreas Krautwald:

"The Norwegian Bible Society knew what they wanted, and gave us a clear brief from the beginning. This translation had already been published in a number of traditional designs, and now they wanted something completely different, a sparkling new look, in 6 different flavours. Off course, when working with Norwegians, you always have to double up because they print in both nynorsk and bokmål. There is something to be said about designing and typesetting twelve books in one go. It keeps you on your toes."

# The book as an object

"The Trend line is a series in its own right. Within the series, there are two lines designed for different audiences; the medium sized books and the small books. All of the materials -- and the processing of the materials are thought into the design; and all six designs have binding styles that set them apart from traditional books."

The medium-sized books have soft, flexible PU-covers with embossed patterns, inspired by Norwegian nature and culture.  "This PU binding changes colour when it is embossed. That adds a whole range of possibilities to the graphic expression, as blind embossment changes both texture and colour of the material."
